explosm_127,"The core of the humor lies in its creative play on the phrase “my eyes are up here” and adapting it to the blind man. By following the narrative, we see that the first panel involves the blind man poking the lady in the chest area, with the lady yelling “my eyes are up here”. This phrase is commonly for people who can see and would be staring at the chest of women. Thus, it’s a creative play/twist on the phrase for the blind man; treating the stick as the way a blind man would “see”. In the second panel, the man then pokes the eye of the woman, leaning into the that twist of the phrase. "
explosm_3279,"The humor lies in playing with how the term “mixed signs” are used. In the conversation between the two characters, “mixed signs” was used in the context of a relationship between the green shirt lady and a construction worker. However, the “mixed signs” was conveyed in a literal sense (through the traffic signs which is appropriate because the partner in the relationship is a construction worker) in the following panels which subverts the expectation of the reader.  "
explosm_4467,The humor of this comic lies in breaking the fourth wall which makes it unexpected. We can see this by following the narrative of the comic where the magic pencil that can draw conclusions would then conclude the comic by killing the character with the green shirt. 
explosm_136,"A swingers club is a brothel (a place for paid sexual services). The humor lies in how the cell was able to be serviced despite the club being “couples only” as shown in the sign. To be serviced, the cell split into two (with an exaggerated schlorp sound) to become a “couple” to overcome the challenge of not being serviced when it was a single cell. "
explosm_1062,"The humor in this comic lies in the word “sixteen inches” being interpreted in a sexual manner. By following the narrative, we see that the lady in the green shirt is asking a salesperson the difference between a queen size and a king size bed. Upon answering the size difference (sixteen inches), a king appeared in the second panel affirming the answer which in this new context, is unexpected: involving sexual and dark humor connotations. "
explosm_1156,"The humor lies in playing with the idea of winning the orgy competition despite being last. In a typical competition (like racing), you would want to finish first. However, in this context, finishing last imply that the man lasted the longest: he would then become the best in this specific orgy competition. We can also see this with the last panel delivering the punchline by presenting the person with the gold trophy."
explosm_1199,"The humor lies in the last (punchline) panel where the person threaten to kill the guy if he wants his shoe back. By following the narrative, we can see how the man in the orange shirt said his (recently praised) shoes are from a dead man. Next, the man, whose shoes were stolen, appeared and mentioned that he is not dead. Finally, the punchline is delivered. This comic have connotations of dark humor. "
explosm_2591,"The humor lies in taking the phrase “suicidal thoughts” literally. By following the narrative, the man in the green shirt is comforting the man in the blue shirt who is having suicidal thoughts. In a typical scenario similar to this, the man that is having suicidal thoughts would want to talk about the difficulties that he is facing and try to resolve these thoughts. However, in the final (punchline) panel, he showed that he is having “suicidal thoughts” for others by telling the man in the green shirt to kill himself while crying to further amplify the humor. "
explosm_2938,"The humor lies in the way “cutting in line” was used literally instead of the usual expected way of jumping the queue. The humor is amplified with the second panel showing that the people are queuing for the Assisted Suicide Center, implying that cutting themselves (a behaviour associated with suicidal or dark thoughts) would ruin the business of this center and the person “cutting in line” should not do that"
explosm_4145,"The humor in this comic lies in the second character wearing the blue shirt taking advantage of the clapper lights feature. By following the narrative, we see that the blue shirt’s guy took off their clothes after the lights got turned off and on in the first three panels. Afterwhich, the character without clothes gave a (perverted) smirk/look at the other character with the green shirt before clapping the lights to turn it off; implying sexual or suggestive actions taking place after the lights switched off. "
garfield_1134,"The humor in this comic lies within a few aspects: the sarcastic thoughts by garfield, the deadpan neutral face that garfield is making as compared to the more excited face of Jon. We can observe this by following the narrative with Jon being excited because he (presumably) used teeth whiteners by smiling and showing his teeth to garfield (who is clearly unimpressed). Afterwhich, the sarcasm is delivered by garfield by mentioning that Jon's whitened teeth is ""burning his retinas"" implying that it is so white it reflects light to burn garfield's eyes."
garfied_2158,"The polka palace is from the educational children show The Backyardigans, by Nickelodeon. The humor lies in how Jon's happy place being the palace party is not very agreeable with Garfield, implying that Garfield (or the author) do not think that the show is very good/entertaining. We can infer this interaction/intention in the final panel where Garfield looks shocked when Jon mentioned the polka palace as his happy place."
garfield_96,"The humor lies in how Garfield offered the absurdly small portions of cookies (because it was baked by a mouse) to share with Jon. By following the narrative, Jon noticed the smell of peanut butter cookies which prompted Garfield to investigate. Afterwhich, Garfield met with a mouse (who was responsible for the cookies), and brought the cookies back to share with Jon as the mouse baked a double batch. The humor is amplified with the unimpressed face of Jon while Garfield showed him the cookies with a smirk."
garfield_872,"The humor in this comic lies in how Garfield's day was ruined by Jon. By following the narrative, we know that it is setting of the comic is in the morning. Upon encountering Jon (who seems happy to see Garfield), Garfield then turn away from Jon and walk away while mentioning that his day is ruined. The humor is amplified by how quickly Garfield's day is ruined upon encountering Jon and how this might be relatable to some people. "
garfield_1593,"The humor in this comic largely lies in the tired and haggared expression of Garfield. By following the narrative, Jon quoted from the newspaper that one should start a Monday morning with a smile while showing the exhausted face of Garfield. This contrast forms the basis of the humor. Afterwhich, the humor is amplified when Garfield offered a ""scream of desparation"" which would be the opposite of a ""smile"" and Jon acknowledging that Garfield doesn't care by mentioning ""or not""."
garfield_4111,"The humor lies in how cats have to sleep for many hours in a day. We can understand this humor by following the narrative where Garfield presents a joke (with implications that the audience are fellow cats), mentioning that even after a ten-hour nap is not enough for a cat and it would be described as ""sleep deprived""."
garfield_21,"The humor lies in how Garfield would want to visit the Donut Shop for the next vacation with Jon. We can observe this by following the narrative in the comic, where Garfield encountered a Donut Shop in the second panel and is noticeable happier upon doing so. In the subsequent panel, Jon asked Garfield where would be their next vacation; to which Garfield was happy that he asked (implying that the next vacation should be the Donut Shop)."
garfield_599,"The humor lies in how Garfield intends to lie down for such a long time that either he grows out roots or plants start growing from him as an expression to show that he is determined to not move. The humor is amplified by how Jon seems nonchalant about the situation from his facial expression and his interaction with Garfield, and how determined Garfield is in not moving (with the punchline ""until I put out roots, pal"")."
garfield_4335,"The humor lies in how the ball of yarn called out to Garfield's sweater as it's mom. Following the sequence of panels, the first two panels showed how Garfield noticed the ball of yarn. The third panel showed Garfield asking the ball of yarn to stop staring at it's sweater, to which the ball of yarn called out ""mom?"". This is humorous because the sweater could have been made from (the same) yarn, personifying the ball of yarn."
garfield_3400,"The humor lies in how Garfield express the ""uselessness"" of a dog. By following the narrative, we can observe that the computer announced a new discovery for a dog's breath (removing paint). Afterwhich, Garfield expressed, with a smirk, that there is finally a use for dogs; which also imply that there was no/little use for dogs before this discovery."
peanuts_152,"The humor lies in how Charlie Brown regretted asking the gang to talk it up out there. By following the narrative, we can see how Lucy (the girl) started yapping non-stop with a good amount of trash-talk after the guy asked the team to speak up more in their game. The final panel then expressed how the guy ""shouldn't have said anything"", implying regret."
peanuts_2253,"The humor lies in how the character comic submitting to the teacher despite claiming that he will not accept the new teacher and that the ""othmarites"" (presumably referring to himself as part of othmarite) are stubborn. This is largely seen in how the kid would still follow the new replacement teacher's instructions despite seemingly rebelling against it when we follow the narrative of the comic."
peanuts_1654,"The humor lies in the dynamic between the dog and the boy in the comic. There is an implication that the human is superior to the dog in the second panel in the manner the boy expressed the ""human's great tradition of forgiveness"" for the dog when it failed to retrieve the stick. In the subsequent panels, a twist occured where the dog refused the second chance given; as if subverting the notion of dogs being inferior to humans. This sequence of events laid the foundation for the humor."
peanuts_1349,"The humor lies in how serious the note left by the mom and how the character reading it thought it was too exaggerated/serious. By following the narrative, we can observe that the mom left a note in the lunch of the character in a red shirt, with it's contents having a serious conversation (such as how ""our generation has failed yours...""). After which, the final panel delivers an unexpected line from the character in the red shirt, by saying in a much less serious tone ""mom gets carried away"", contrasting the serious tone in the note with an unserious tone by the boy."
peanuts_764,"The humor in this comic plays with the cliché of the father not approving his daughter's relationship if the boyfriend is not up to the father's standards. In the comic, we can observe this as Snoopy could not get married with his girlfriend because of the father's disapproval. The reason for the disapproval is because of Snoopy dropping out of ""obedience school"" (which is presumably a school for dogs to be more obedient to their owners) similar to how someone in real life would not meet the high expectations of a father if they dropped out of school."
peanuts_137,"The humor lies in how Snoopy doesn't trust bird because of the movie ""The Birds"" by Alfred Hitchcock. The movie is a horror film involving bird attacks, which explains why Snoopy doesn’t trust birds and chased them away when the blue birds landed next to him."
peanuts_4598,"The humor in this comic lies in how the bird ""stereotype"" all beagles looking the same when Snoopy mentioned that he miss his brother Spike, and questioned if he could recognize him after not seeing Spike for so long. The humor is amplified by how Snoopy express his significant disapproval in response to the bird in the final panel of the comic (giving a humanistic expression to Snoopy)."
peanuts_384,"The humor in this comic lies in how Snoopy kicked charles off the snowy hill after Charles said that they can face any dangers ahead if they go together. By kicking Charles off, Snoopy left Charles to the face the dangers alone. The humor is amplified by the unexpected nature of Snoopy's action in kicking Charles, and the comedic timing of kicking him off after he said to stick together. "
peanuts_4392,"The humor in this comic plays with the famous proverb ""he who lives by the sword dies by the sword"" and interchanging the ""sword"" with the ""bad call"" in the comic. The original proverb suggests the people who use violence often meet a violent end themselves. Inferring from this description, the way snoopy describes it suggests that him calling out a bad call would mean that he would likely meet his ""end"" due to a bad call as well."
peanuts_1993,"The humor in this comic lies in the exasperation of the girl in the last panel of the comic. By following the narrative, we see that the tent monitor describes (in a lot of detail) her special nicknames like ""peppermint"" and ""rare gem"" before asking the other girls what their names are. In response, one of the girls suggested that they can't ""beat"" the cool nicknames that the tent monitor had by the way she expressed ""after all that, what can we say?"". The unexpected way the girl responded also help to amplify the humor. "
phdcomics_1541,"The humor in this comic lies in how the professor doesn't really care about the technical details of the plot, but in how ""pretty"" it looks. By following the narrative, the professor liking how pretty the plot looks is unexpected as one would expect the professor to be impressed by the results and the technical methods for the plot, and not the aesthetics of the plot. The final panel amplify the humor by the stating that the student just used a standard plotting function (implying that this is normal or standard which sort of downplayed the effort and thought for the technical details) with the professor being impressed that a computer could do it."
phdcomics_1662,"The humor in this comic lies in the word play of ""remotely"". We can observe this by following the narrative where prof. rivera is leaving the university and would remotely supervise his previous student. After which, the prof told the student that he would be ""remotely advising her"", which prompted the student to ask if she is graduating ""remotely"" or ""remotely graduating"". The punchline in the final panel delivered by the prof mentioned that either way, it would be ""remotely painful""; again, playing on the different ways ""remotely"" can be used."
phdcomics_186,"The humor in this comic plays with the term HIIT (high intensity interval training) by adapting it to ""HIFI"" (high intensity faculty intelligence). This comparison can be observed with the way the student is exhausted, the same way one would be exhausted after HIIT, with the adaptation being the student ""intensely"" reading and/or writing."
phdcomics_1439,"The humor in this comic lies in the (comical) interaction between the professor and the student. By following the narrative, we observe that the professor would rather rewrite the entire draft than to point out the mistakes of the student and describing this as a method to learn by ""demonstration"" (with a deadpan face). In response, the student was confused by what the professor was ""demonstrating"", and the punchline in the final comic from the professor being ""that you are a bad writer"". One would typicall expected an actual ""demonstration"" of something useful or important by the prof, but the ""demonstration"" was simply a way to show that the student is bad at writing which makes up the core of the punchline/humor."
phdcomics_1255,"The humor in this comic lies in how academics are not ""regular people"" and are expected to work even on off days (weekends/public holiday like thanksgiving). The humor is amplified by the facial expressions of the student being shocked, and the facial expression and reponse of the professor in the last panel by replying ""thankfully no""; the word ""thankfully"" implying that not being a regular person and working on off-days is a good thing."
phdcomics_392,"The humor in this comic lies in how the student with the glasses think that Mike (the guy without glasses) knows him. From the comic setting and by following the narrative, we see the guy with the glasses feeling nostalgic and is thinking of coming back to the lab. As he conversed with Mike in a one-sided conversation, Mike thinks that he looks familiar, but doesn't know his name which makes the interaction comical as the guy with the glasses overshare/continue speaking and elaborating on coming back to grad school."
phdcomics_472,"The humor in this comic plays on the common idea that phd students don't go outside often (and therefor don't get much sunshine). By following the narrative, we can observe that the girl in the red shirt deciding to go outside; after which, she was dazzled by the sun (with her exaggerated reaction amplifying the humor), before finally delivering the punchline in the final panel by saying the sun is overrated (which reinforced the idea that phd students do not go outside often)."
phdcomics_543,"The humor in this comic lies in the unexpected receiver of the email. The email was drafted by the guy in the comic where he put in a lot of effort and thought into it. One would expect the addressee of the email to be someone important in his work, but it turns out to be just his parents (which one would expect a more comfortable/casual email that would not require a lot of thought or effort). "
phdcomics_753,"The humor in this comic lies in how the man continues to think about the work despite the comfortable setting with his family he is currently in. To further elaborate, this comic also plays on the idea that researchers constantly think about work or problems even in a more comfortable setting. Also, the humor is amplified by fact that the (presumably) wife of the man knew what he would be thinking, and asking the question nonchalantly, implying that this might have happened before."
phdcomics_514,"The humor in this comic lies in how the woman (in the final panel) thought that the man had worked a lot throughout the day due to his aching neck. However, by following the narrative, the man was in fact not working and the cause of his neck pain was because of him constantly dozing off in front of him computer."
smbc_1603,"The humor in this comic plays with the popular term ""BFF"" which stands for best friend forever by modifying it to ""PFF"" postdoc fellow forever. This is humorous because if the character with the red hair does indeed have a great relationship with his principle investigator (PI), the PI would continue to keep him as a postdoc fellow; hence, a literal ""postdoc fellow"" forever."
smbc_2399,"The humor in this comic lies in a word play by relating the popular phrase ""money can't buy happiness"" with the idea of using drugs (heroin) for happiness. It's humorous because drugs usually make the user happy through dopamin and you can in fact buy drugs (heroin in this comic) for ""happiness"". "
smbc_1175,"Pundits are people who offer their opinion in an authoritative manner. Thus, the humor in this comic lies in mocking people who falsely believe certain conspiracy theories (in this case, believing that the Earth is a cube) by showing how the scientist might reason, through a similarly absurd way of a pundit, that the Earth is a cube."
smbc_18,"The humor in this comic have multiple layers: the first layer involves how the child uses logic to warp the explanation of why it is raining (because God is crying) to help farmers; the second layer is how the child mentioned that she is thinking of going into politics, underscoring the idea of how people in politics manipulate people by doing bad things but framing it in a good way (doing evil things to help farmers in the third panel)."
smbc_1876,"The humor in this comic lies in how the man providing the testimonial didn't have an explanation for why the drunk driver would have an opportunity to hit him if his car was not broken. By following the narrative, we see the man providing various reasons why God did certain things that are conventionally deemed to be bad or unlucky. Upon ending his testimonial on why God broke his car, a boy from the audience questioned the reason for the cause of breaking his car (the drunk driver); to which, the man seem to have no explanation for (given his shocked/worried face) and ran off in a comical manner."
smbc_1297,There are two layers to the humor in this comic. The first (and main) layer involved the ineffective use of euphemism (a substitution of words with a milder impact as opposed to a blunt/unpleasant word) by the lady to describe that she had shot the dog. The second layer involves on how what the lady said could be misinterpreted in a sexual/suggestive manner. The top text offering the life tip also helped amplify the humor (the scenario is sort of the example for this life tip).
smbc_795,"The humor in this comic lies in how ""myspace"" is treated literally to allow the man into the president's press conference. By treating ""myspace"" literally, the man would have a spot (place) in the conference. Alternatively, having a myspace account in the past could have been a way to show that you are influential (since myspace is an older social networking site), and the man could help share the information in the conference similar to a reporter."
smbc_156,"The humor in this comic lies in connecting the idea of r-strategists (species that prioritize high reproductive rates) with infidelity or cheating (which is a more human concept). The comic personified the two frogs, showing how one of the frogs is disappointed in the other by ""cheating"" on it with an absurdly large number of other frogs (because of the frogs being r-strategists)."
smbc_4879,"The humor in this comic lies in how the rocket scientist describes a strategy to win a marathon using the same strategy for a rocket. In an absurd manner, the strategy by the rocket scientist to win the marathon is to ""jettison"" the limbs, arms, and torso to reach the finish line using minimum energy; the same way a rocket would jettison other segments to use less fuel. The humor is then amplified by the bottom statement (punchline) claiming as a fun fact that no rocket scientists has ever won a marathon."
smbc_4972,"The humor in this comic lies in how elaborate and deep the arguments the man is making about ""great art"" which ended up being subverted by the fact that he draws webcomics about cats and anxiety. The humor is amplified by the fact that the man build up a long and complicated reasoning for art movements and showing how sophisticated he is in his thinking. Also, his final line ""a man must eat, madam"" helped to boost its comedic effect/timing."
they_can_talk_106,"The humor in this comic lies in how the cat and dog behave like humans (personification). By following the narrative, we can observe that that cat is disturbed a a foul smell, followed by the dog claiming that it ""accidentally"" rolled in something. Afterwhich, the cat looked unimpressed/doesn't believe the dog which prompted the dog to admit that it intentionally rolled in something (that probably is the cause of the smell)."
they_can_talk_30,"The humor in this comic lies in how the human threw away the ball which brought much joy to the dog. It is humorous because the dog felt that the ball, bringing so much joy to it, is important and should share it with others. Yet, when it brought the ball to the human, the human threw the ball away thinking the dog wanted to play; this act of throwing the ball away is akin to the human throwing the sincerity/thought/noble feelings of the dog wanting the human to experience joy away which is unexpected."
they_can_talk_123,"The humor in this comic lies in how the dog is begging for a ""second-dinner"" and is trying to convince the human that there is a ""second dinner"". The humor is further amplified by the repetition of the word ""remember"", as if the dog is trying to convince the human the they had truly forgotten to serve the ""second-dinner"". This also plays on the fact that dogs commonly want more food or treats wherever possible in the real world."
they_can_talk_160,"The humor in this comic lies in interactions between the two tadpoles in the comic. The darker green tadpole wishes to be a mighty bullfrog (which is expected because it is a tadpole) while the other lighter green tadpole hopes to be an eagle (which is clearly impossible). The final two panels drive home the humor by showing the ""are you serious?"" face of the darker green tadpole, and then the innocent and naive face of the lighter green tadpole."
they_can_talk_81,The humor in this comic lies in the way the cat is convinced that it possesses telekinesis by moving the leaf even though it is most likely due to the wind. The humor is amplified by the serious facial expressions of the cat and how it is also trying to convey its seriousness to another grey cat.
they_can_talk_103,"The humor in this comic lies in how the way penguins move (waddling in a cute way, but no so quick). By following the narrative, we can see that one of the penguin is alerting the other penguins that a predator is nearby (the leopard seal). This is followed by a dramatic scream to tell the penguins to run. The punchline in the final panel showed that the penguins are ""running"" (or waddling) as quick as they can. Alternatively, the penguin may also have realized that ""run"" is not the best word to use, and thus they should ""waddle faster"" away from the seal."
they_can_talk_85,"The humor in this comic lies in the different ways the headbutt behaviour is used in the goat and the cat. For cats, the headbutt behaviour is a sign of affection. However, goats tend to use headbutts for fights. Thus, by following the narrative, the ""most sincere affection"" the goat is expressing implies that the goat wishes to headbutt the cat (very hard) and its not really to express ""affection"" in the language of cats."
they_can_talk_381,"The humor in this comic lies in the nonchalantly way the cat tell it's owner that it puked in the kitchen, before wishing them merry christmas. The humor is amplified by the fact that the puke would have ruined the person's day, but the cat still wished the owner merry christmas (seemingly in a mocking manner).  The merry christmas also had a nice comedic timing."
they_can_talk_397,"The humor in this comic lies in the seahorse's confusion. The humor can be interpreted in a way where the seahorse also represent us, the humans, in being confused of where the starfish's face is as the creature is quite strange looking. Further, the confused face of the seahorse further amplified the confusion and humor."
they_can_talk_141,The humor in this comic lies in how the first bird doesn't actually know where it is going despite the other birds following it. The humor is further amplifified by how the bird looked stressed after another bird told it that the rest are following it; implying that the leading bird doesn't actually know where they are going.
xkcd_1038,"The humor in this comic lies in how the stickman ""fly away"" (in a cute and silly way) with his umbrella. We can observe this by following the narrative where the stickman encounters a powerful water jet at the water fountain. Afterwhich, he opened his umbrella to catch the strong water jet and be propelled upwards. The humor is amplified with the ""wheeee"" sound effect by the stickman."
xkcd_2966,"The humor in this comic lies in the way how math comes a full circle from kindergarten to postgraduate. By following the narrative, we observe how math progresses in difficulty from kindergarten to calculus to postgraduate: the questions get more complicated as it progresses in difficulty. Yet, the final panel (postgraduate), presumably the hardest, have the same question as the kindergarten. This is humorous because at this level of math, one would have learn many theorems and understood math to a degree that answering this seemingly straightforward question would be extremely complicated at this level; hence, coming a full circle by asking the same question as the kindergarten math exam."
xkcd_262,"The humor in this comic plays with how the internet likes to put captions on cat related content to give them a more humorous/funny/human expression in the content (memes, short form videos etc). The humor is further amplified by how the other man shouted ""what are you doing"", showing that he is shocked and/or confused and/or in disbelief that the man is doing something absurd to the cats."
xkcd_333,"The humor in this comic lies in how the man doesn’t know what to do in an intimate setting. This can be seen in how the man is searching for tips/guide on ""foreplay"" which is a very intimate act in the bedroom before sexual intercourse. The act of searching for a guide despite being in bed also underscored how absurd the situation is."
xkcd_2374,"The humor in this comic lies in how it plays with the idea of spending many hours on something to become an expert. By following the narrative, the phone is (presumably) showing content that claims that someone would be an expert if the spend 10,000 hous on something. This fact then directly connects to the how long one would spend looking at their phone (screen time): spending a long time on the screen is conventionally viewed as a bad thing, but the ""screen"" is now saying that spending a lot of time looking at it is now a good thing (becoming an expert). Thus,  the screen is ""trying to put a positive spin on things"" in the final statement."
xkcd_2966,"The humor in this comic references the old website of myspace, where it would play the first five seconds of the song very loudly upon reaching the page. This humour is partly meant for nostalgia (for people who could relate to this experience) and also to exaggerate this experience by underscoring ""love"" when most people don't really appreciate the song being blasted for five seconds."
xkcd_2453,"The humor in this comic lies in playing with the Church-Turing Thesis (saying that a function can be calculated effectively if it is computable by a turing machine) and Alan Turing (a very important computer scientist). By following the narrative, we can see that the girl is happy a new lambda function is introduced in Excel (allowing an effective method for computation) and tries to convince the guy to use it. The girl then claim that the guy is doing computing ineffectively, in which the guy responded the the church-turing thesis says that all ways of computing are equally wrong. After which, the girl retorted by referencing turing (who authored the thesis) and how turing would change his mind; implying that the man's method is absurdly ineffective/bad. The final statement by the man amplified the humor with another funny response by saying that Turing himself can't prove that he would stop using the ineffective method (a reference to presumably another theory of Turing)."
xkcd_1235,"The humor lies in the lack of evidence for controversial entities like flying saucers, lake monsters, ghosts, and bigfoot. We can observe this by the way the comic shows us the percentage of the US population carrying cameras in their daily lives (presumably because of smartphones), yet there were no photos of these controversial entities. Thus, ""settling the questions"" for these controversial entities."
xkcd_88,"The humor in this comic lies in the mobius band/strip the Escher used in a lot of his works. The humor is then amplified by the way it references WWJD or ""what would Jesus do?"" by replacing the name ""Jesus"" with ""Escher"" which was a popular movement in the 90s that also involved wearing a band or a bracelet to remind individuals to follow their faith."
xkcd_386,"The humor in this comic lies in how it makes fun of a person feeling the need to respond to someone (who is wrong) on the internet. We can infer this from the conversation in the comic, seeing that the act of the responding to a person who is wrong on the internet is important and that that man on the computer must prioritize this action over sleeping. This exaggeration is the core of the humor."
